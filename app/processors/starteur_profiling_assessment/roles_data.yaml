      Engineers tend to prioritize and then take action. They set goals. These
      goals serve as their compass, helping them determine priorities and make
      alterations when needed to get back on course. They focus, and this
      forces them to filter; they instinctively evaluate each action before
      taking it to determine whether it will help them reach their goal. In the
      end, strong engineers are efficient. They are extremely valuable team
      members because their single-mindedness enhances the speed and quality of
      their performance and keeps the team on track. While others start to
      wander down divergent avenues, good engineers tend to stay on the main
      road. They help others avoid time-consuming distractions and keep
      everyone on point.
    - >
      Engineers tend to love to solve problems. While some are dismayed when
      they encounter yet another breakdown, great engineers are energized by
      it. They enjoy the challenge of analyzing symptoms, identifying what is
      wrong, and finding the solution. They like bringing things back to life
      by fixing them or rekindling their vitality. In short, they bring courage
      and creativity to problematic situations. Great engineers bring a
      solution-oriented mind-set to daily problems. They readily take on
      projects that others believe “can’t be saved.” They can analyze a
      situation, identify potential shortcomings, and make the necessary
      adjustments.

      “When can we start?” This is a recurring question for product managers.
      They tend to be impatient for action. They may concede that analysis has its
      uses or that debate and discussion can occasionally yield some valuable
      insights, but deep down they know that only action is real. Once a decision
      is made, they must act. Others may worry that “there are still some things we
      don’t know,” but this doesn’t seem to slow great product managers down. They
      make a decision, take action, look at the result, and learn. The bottom line
      is this: product managers know they will be judged not by what they say or
      what they think, but by what they get done. This does not frighten them. It
      energizes them. Product managers are catalysts who get things started. They
      naturally see how to turn ideas into action. As a result, they make things
      happen. Their energy can be contagious and engaging. If you have an
      important project or talented group that simply needs a “jump start,”, they
      will bring energy and instant momentum.
    - >
      Great product managers have the ability to sort through the clutter and
      find the best route. This is a skill that is difficult to be taught. It
      is a distinct way of thinking — a special perspective on the world at
      large. This outlook allows them to see patterns where others simply see
      complexity. Mindful of these patterns, they are able to envision
      alternative scenarios, always asking, “What if this happened?” This
      recurring question helps them see, plan, and prepare for future
      situations. They see a way when others assume there is no way. Armed with
      this strategy, they strike forward. Great product managers bring creative
      anticipation, imagination, and persistence to the groups and projects
      they work on. They can quickly weigh alternative paths and determine the
      one that will work best and most efficiently. They find the best route
      moving forward.

  role: "Sales Manager"
  icon_file: "report/role_icons_sales.svg"
  description:
    - >
      Great sales managers have a constant need for attainment. They have an
      internal fire burning inside them. It pushes them to do more, to achieve
      more. They often feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day
      they must accomplish something meaningful to feel good about themselves.
      And “every day” means every single day — workdays, weekends, holidays, and
      even vacations. If the day passes without some form of achievement, no
      matter how small, they then to feel dissatisfied. Upon finishing a
      challenging project, they rarely seek to be rewarded with a rest or an easy
      assignment. While they appreciate recognition for past achievements, their
      motivation lies in striving toward the next goal on the horizon. Great
      sales managers love to complete tasks, and they derive fulfilment from
      their accomplishments. Putting it simply, they have a strong inner drive —
      an innate source of intensity, energy, and power that enables them to push
      hard to get things done. As a result, they often set the pace and define
      productivity levels for the people around them.
    - >
      Sales managers tend to compete and compare. For people with strong sales
      manager talents, their performance is their ultimate yardstick. When they
      look at the world, they are instinctively aware of other people’s
      performance. They have a deep aspiration to be the best and will work hard
      to excel — especially in comparison with others. It’s not about the effort;
      it is about the win. Regardless of effort or intention, even if they reach
      their goal, their achievement will feel hollow if they did not outperform
      their peers. They need to compare. If they can compare, they can compete,
      and if they can compete, they can win. Great sales managers have the
      ability to stimulate themselves and others to a higher standard of
      performance. They can raise a group’s achievement level by creating a
      culture of winning and an aspiration to be the best.

  role: "Business Developer"

  description:

      Business developers tend to live in the moment. They don’t see the future
      as a fixed destination. Instead, they see it as a place that they can create
      out of the choices they make right now. They discover their future one choice
      at a time. This doesn’t mean that they don’t have plans. But their
      flexibility enables them to respond willingly to the demands of the moment,
      even if circumstances pull them away from their plans. They don’t resent
      sudden requests or unforeseen detours. They expect them. Indeed, on some
      level they may actually look forward to them. They are, at heart, very
      adaptable, and they can stay productive when circumstances pull them in many
      different directions at once. The genius of great business developers lies in
      the way they respond to chaos: they can quickly change and respond to
      circumstances that would frighten or intimidate others. Great business
      developers find ways to keep moving forward when the unexpected happens.
      Their natural ability to be in the moment can help others see the way
      forward.
    - >
      Great business developers naturally take charge. They see what needs to be
      done, and they are willing to speak up. They are not frightened by
      confrontation; rather, they understand that confrontation is the first step
      toward resolution. They need things to be clear among people and will
      challenge others to be realistic and honest. This pushes them to take
      risks. At times, great business developers may intimidate others. And while
      some may resent this, others often willingly hand them the reins. People
      are drawn toward those who take a stand and are willing to lead. Great
      business developers bring decisiveness and emotional clarity. They have the
      ability to bring to light what is often avoided or unstated. This gives
      them the ability to resolve conflicts and misunderstandings.

  role: "Marcomms Manager"

      Great marcomms managers like to explain, describe, host, present, and
      write. Their natural talents enable them to bring ideas and events vividly
      to life. They turn thoughts and actions into stories, images, examples, and
      metaphors. They want their information — whether an idea, an event, a
      discovery, or a lesson — to captivate the audience. This drives them to
      hunt for the perfect phrase and draws them toward dramatic words and
      powerful statements. In the end, this is why people like listening to them.
      Their word pictures pique interest, provide clarity, and inspire others to
      act. Great marcomms managers bring attention and focus to important
      messages. They can find words for not only their own thoughts and feelings,
      but for those of others. This gives them the ability to reach out and
      connect with others in meaningful ways.
    - >
      Great marcomms managers are able to win others over. They enjoy the
      challenge of encountering new people and gaining their esteem. They are
      drawn to meeting new people. They want to learn others’ names, ask them
      questions, and find common interests upon which to build rapport. Great
      marcomms managers can enter a crowd and easily know what to do and say.
      Some people shy away from starting up conversations because they worry
      about running out of things to say. Great marcomms managers do not. They
      see no strangers — only friends they haven’t met yet. They bring energy to
      social situations. They can connect with others and act as catalysts in
      helping people connect with one another. They have an exceptional ability
      to draw others out of their shell.

      Gifted designers are creative and appreciate originality. They relish
      free-thinking experiences such as brainstorming and discussion groups. They
      have a natural capacity to consider issues from multiple perspectives. They
      revel in taking the world we all know and turning it around so people can
      view it from a strangely enlightening angle. They think outside the box.
      They are fascinated by new ideas and concepts, which come to them easily.
      They love ideas because they can be profound, they can be novel, they can
      be clarifying, they can be contrary, and they can be bizarre. For all these
      reasons they derive a jolt of energy whenever a new idea occurs to them.
      Great designers are spontaneously creative and bring new and fresh
      perspectives. They have a natural sense of innovation that defies
      conventional thinking. Their innovative approach to problems and projects
      can be a source of new and valuable ideas.
    - >
      Talented designers tend to be inquisitive. They always want to know more.
      They crave information. They like to collect certain things, such as ideas,
      books, memorabilia, quotations, or facts. Whatever they collect, they do it
      because it interests them. They find many things interesting and have a
      natural curiosity. The world is exciting precisely because of its infinite
      variety and complexity. A few minutes of surfing the internet may turn into
      hours once their curiosity takes off. They constantly acquire, compile, and
      file things away. Their pursuits keep their minds fresh. And they know that
      one day some of the information or things they have gathered will prove
      valuable. Great designers bring tools that can facilitate growth and
      performance. They love to provide relevant and tangible help to others.
      Their resourcefulness and curiosity lead them to store knowledge that can
      be culled and shared.

      Strong marketers tend to challenge others to “Prove it.” They take a
      critical approach to what others might quickly accept as truth. They search
      for the reasons why things are the way they are. They want to understand
      how certain patterns affect one another. How do they combine? What is the
      outcome? Does this outcome fit with the theory offered or the situation at
      hand? These are their questions. Others see them as logical and rigorous.
      Some may feel that they are negative or unnecessarily critical when they
      are simply trying to understand something. They bring an objective and
      dispassionate examination that enables them to find the root causes and
      effects, and then develop clear thoughts based on facts. Talented marketers
      have valuable insights because they are able to uncover the essential facts
      needed for excellence in any endeavour. This type of thinking helps them
      and others become clearer about what excellence is and how it can be
      attained.
    - >
      Gifted marketers see talents and strengths in others, usually before anyone
      else does. Strengths — whether their own or someone else’s — fascinate them.
      Great marketers love to drive projects or help others reach their maximum
      potential. They have the capacity to see what aspects work best and what
      methods reap the greatest payoff. Excellence, not average, is their measure
      and pursuit. They have a quality orientation that leads them to focus on
      areas of strength for themselves and others and to manage around weakness.
      Gifted marketers have and bring to others a focus on quality. They naturally
      prefer working with and for the best. They create strengths within groups by
      enabling each person to do what he or she naturally does best. Their drive
      toward excellence can lead to a new standard of success.

      Great customer service managers can sense the emotions of those around
      them. They can feel what others are feeling as though the emotions were
      their own. They intuitively see the world through others’ eyes and share
      their perspectives. They perceive people’s pain or joy — sometimes before
      it is even expressed. Their instinctive ability to understand is powerful.
      They can hear unvoiced questions and anticipate needs. Where others grapple
      for words, they seem to find the right things to say and strike the right
      tone. As a result, they help people express their feelings — to themselves
      as well as to others. They help people give voice to their emotional lives.
      Talented customer service managers are able to build and form relationships
      that have great emotional depth. Others feel understood by them and seek
      their company. Their innate ability to understand the emotions of those
      around them provides comfort and stability.
    - >
      Talented customer service managers want peace and try to bring others
      together. In their view, little can be gained from conflict and friction,
      so they seek to hold these to a minimum. Those with innate talents of a
      great customer service manager see what people have in common, even during
      conflict. They try to steer others away from confrontation and toward
      reconciliation. In fact, harmony is one of their guiding values. They seek
      to help individuals, families, and organizations work together. When others
      argue, they steer clear of the debate, preferring to talk about practical,
      down-to-earth matters on which everyone can agree. The particular
      brilliance of great customer service managers is their natural practicality
      and preference for balance. By reducing friction, they can enhance
      collaboration. They avert many contentious interactions before they start
      and quickly help others find a resolution.

      Admin managers are conductors. When faced with a complex situation
      involving many factors, they enjoy managing all of the variables, aligning
      and realigning them until they are sure they have arranged them in the most
      productive configuration possible. They are shining examples of effective
      flexibility, whether they are changing travel schedules at the last minute
      because they found a better fare or are mulling over just the right
      combination of people and resources to accomplish a new project. From the
      mundane to the complex, they are always looking for the perfect
      configuration. They are at their best in dynamic situations. Confronted
      with the unexpected, they jump into the confusion, devise new options, hunt
      for new paths, and figure out new partnerships — because, after all, there
      might just be a better way.
    - >
      Great admin managers thrive in an organized and orderly environment. They
      like their days to be predictable and planned, so they instinctively find
      ways to organize their lives. They set up routines. They focus on timelines
      and deadlines. They break long-term projects into a series of specific,
      short-term steps, and follow their plan diligently. They are not
      necessarily neat and tidy, but they do need precision. They create order
      and structure where needed. Some people may label them as compulsive,
      meticulous, or control freaks, but these attributes make them productive —
      often more so than their critics. Talented admin managers love things that
      are organized and orderly. They meet deadlines. And they can efficiently
      manage limited resources. They bring a high level of organization, order,
      and stability to the projects and groups in which they work.

      Great finance managers are careful and vigilant. Everything may seem in
      order, but beneath the surface they sense many risks. Rather than
      avoiding these hazards, they draw each one out into the open. Then each
      risk can be identified, assessed, and ultimately reduced. Finance
      managers bring a thorough and conscientious approach to making decisions.
      They take care to consider options, thinking through the pros and cons of
      each alternative.  To them, making the correct choice is more important
      than the time it takes to do so. They see life as something of a
      minefield. Others can run through it recklessly if they so choose, but
      they take a different approach. They identify the dangers, weigh their
      relative effect, and then place their feet deliberately. They walk with
      care. Great finance managers bring a thorough and conscientious approach
      to their endeavours. They have the ability to reduce risk and prevent
      problems through natural anticipation and careful thought. As a result,
      they tend to make outstanding decisions.
    - >
      Talented finance managers tend to take psychological ownership for
      anything they commit to, whether it is large or small, and they feel
      emotionally bound to follow it through to completion. They keep their
      promises and honour their commitments. They don’t let people down, and
      they work very hard to fulfil all of their responsibilities and keep
      their word. Their conscientiousness, their drive for doing things right,
      and their impeccable ethics combine to create the reputation of being
      utterly dependable. The genius of great finance managers stems from the
      deep sense of dedication and ownership they feel toward the things they
      commit to. They are people of their word, and others know they can rely
      on and trust them.
