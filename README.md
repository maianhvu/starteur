This application was coded to make use of a local PostgreSQL database instead of Sqlite3, so make sure you get yourself a local running server for postgres. For OS X, you may obtain the utility at [this website](http://postgresapp.com/).

Spring has been disabled for this repo, so if you want preloaded binstubs please install [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus).

Remember to setup the database locally by running `zeus rake db:setup` or `zeus rake db:migrate`.

Run RSpec tests by executing `zeus test` or `zeus rspec`.
